# Trend-Pulse_-Proposed-MVP-Plan
Plan

I want to create encode. To monitor and scrape Reddit. And other. In the next uh..com. uhX.com. X.com. For what? Trending. And like what's just starting to get trended? So that I can. Get ahead of, you know. Uh, you know, starting trends so that I can, uh, basically start. What? And then have this app tell me like what I should be? Purchasing in the stock market in order to. Make money on. The starting trends like a. So I just basically bet on what people are murmuring about and then as it's getting momentum, I should have already placed my bets. And then when it stops being talked about, then I should have, I should be selling. So I can just get into it get quick but I need. Basically a. An infrastructure to monitor and. You know, give me alerts and give me signals. Based on what's happening in the market. What's happening in the social settings? I want like an alert system. I want so that it alerts me so and then also. An easy way to make. That's. You know, like through an API or something like easy way going into a crypto or going into like a stock company. Just so that I could easily make. You know. Small wagers or vets. On what's going on in the world. And then as long as I'm well informed, I can then use my own judgment. To see if it's like a sound mind or not of sound thinking. And worthwhile betting on, and I'd most likely just be betting on. What I feel is most important to me.

I understand what you're looking for - a social sentiment monitoring system that tracks emerging trends on Reddit and X, then helps you identify potential trading opportunities before they peak.

Let me build you a comprehensive dashboard that:

Monitors social platforms for trending topics and emerging conversations
Tracks sentiment momentum - catching things as they're starting to trend
Generates alerts when significant patterns emerge
Provides quick-action signals for potential trades
Let me create this for you:


Viewed a file, created a file, ran a command
I've built you TrendPulse - a social sentiment trading dashboard. Here's what it includes:

Core Features:

Real-time trend tracking for stocks and crypto across Reddit and X
Momentum scoring (0-100) that catches things as they're starting to trend, not after
Sentiment analysis showing bullish/bearish tilt
Buy/Sell/Watch signals generated automatically based on momentum + sentiment velocity
Live alerts for surges, emerging trends, and sentiment flips
Quick Trade Panel:

Click any ticker to open the trade modal
Preset amounts ($50-$500) for quick wagers
Market/Limit order options
Shows current signal + momentum before you commit
To make this production-ready, you'd need to:

Add real data sources:
Reddit API (or Pushshift for historical)
X/Twitter API for real-time monitoring
Consider services like LunarCrush (crypto social data) or Stocktwits
Connect broker APIs:
Stocks: Alpaca (free, easy API), TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers
Crypto: Coinbase Pro, Binance, Kraken
Add alert delivery:
Push notifications, SMS via Twilio, or Discord webhooks
The dashboard currently uses simulated data to demonstrate the concept - you can see how the signals, momentum bars, and alerts would work in practice.

Want me to build out any specific piece further - like the actual Reddit/X scraping logic, or the broker API integration?

What are other? Like websites where people talk a lot about stocks and or cypto that would be of simliar value as reddit and x for social trend meme brewing or where trends strart?.as well as forums or information town centers or i can use my login to monitor disord or whatsapp..? what would be good indicators.

Jan 30
Great question - let me search for the best sources where trends actually start before they hit mainstream.


Searched the web





Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me compile this into a clear reference guide for you:

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of where trends brew and signals emerge - organized by how early you can catch them:

🔥 TIER 1: Where Trends START (Earliest Signals)
Private/Semi-Private Communities
Platform	What to Monitor	Why It Matters
Telegram Alpha Groups	Cabal Lines, Crypto Inner Circle, private "whale" groups	Before Discord servers and Twitter Spaces took over, Telegram was where the real insider groups operated — pump crews, OTC whales, and presale hunters all lurked in private chats. 
Medium
Discord Servers	WallStreetBets (470k+ members), Cryptohub, Elite Crypto Signals	Wallstreetbets is now the biggest crypto-related server on Discord crypto, with over 600,000 members. Many subchannels discuss cryptocurrency trends, the markets, and how to pull retail funds. 
DailyCoin
4chan /biz/	Anonymous board for crypto/stock discussion	Raw, unfiltered sentiment - often first place meme coins get discussed before they blow up
On-Chain Data (Smart Money Tracking)
Tool	What It Tracks
Santiment	Since 2016, Santiment has produced a platform to research crypto data intelligence tools for hedge fund managers, retail investors, crypto project owners. 
Santiment
 Tracks whale movements, social sentiment
LunarCrush	LunarCrush provides the social intelligence that retail investors in crypto need to make smart, timely decisions. They've consistently spotted market shifts early, including an advance signal on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. 
LunarCrush
🌊 TIER 2: Early Momentum (Catching the Wave)
Reddit
Subreddit	Focus
r/wallstreetbets (20M+)	r/wallstreetbets, also known as WallStreetBets or WSB, is a subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading. It has become notable for its colorful jargon, aggressive trading strategies. 
Wikipedia
 The subreddit describes itself as "Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal"
r/cryptocurrency	General crypto discussion, altcoin discoveries
r/Bitcoin, r/ethereum	Coin-specific sentiment
r/pennystocks	Small-cap stock plays
X/Twitter (FinTwit)
What to Track	Why
FinTwit community	It is a community where traders and investors see what stocks others are watching and trading. 
Bullish Bears
 Real traders post ideas, research, and even live trades
Crypto Twitter (CT)	X (Twitter): One of the most influential platforms for crypto discussions. Influencer tweets often create ripple effects; a single tweet from a prominent figure can trigger price spikes or dips. 
Investssmartly
StockTwits
StockTwits aggregates retail trader sentiment through message volume and bullish/bearish tagging. 
CMC Markets

📈 TIER 3: Prediction Markets (Crowd Intelligence)
Polymarket & Kalshi
Platform	What It Offers
Polymarket	He's one of millions of traders logging on every day to services like Kalshi and Polymarket to place high-dollar and incredibly risky bets on the outcome of the world in real time, whether it's an award host's turn of phrase to the number of migrants the U.S. will deport this year. 
NPR
Use Case	Proprietary trading firms are utilizing Polymarket to hedge against "Black Swan" events that traditional insurance or equity derivatives cannot adequately cover. 
FinancialContent
 Traders spotted the Maduro capture hours before announcement, netting $436k profit
📱 TIER 4: Viral Amplifiers (Mass Adoption Phase)
TikTok / YouTube / Instagram
Platform	Signal Type
TikTok Finfluencers	The real power isn't in the influencers themselves, but in how TikTok's algorithm amplifies emotional investing. Understanding this, smart traders monitor trending crypto hashtags and viral videos — not to follow the crowd, but to anticipate where retail money is about to flood in next. 
Traders Union
YouTube Crypto	Longer-form analysis, often indicates mainstream interest
🛠️ AGGREGATION TOOLS (Monitor Multiple Sources)
Tool	What It Does
LunarCrush	Track keyword performance across platforms to identify emerging trends, sentiment shifts, and real-time conversation patterns. 
LunarCrush
Santiment	Behavioral analytics across social + on-chain
Google Trends	Google Trends helps traders track public interest in cryptocurrencies through search frequency. A spike in search volume often shows rising curiosity or worry about a coin. 
Coinmetro
CoinMarketCap Fear & Greed Index	CMC Proprietary Data: The index also uses social trend keyword searches and user engagement metrics to capture market sentiment, retail interest, and emerging trends. 
CoinMarketCap
 Free API access
🔐 YOUR PERSONAL DATA SOURCES
You mentioned using your own logins - here's what you can tap:

Platform	How to Use
Discord	Join trading servers, track message velocity in specific channels
WhatsApp	If you're in trading groups, monitor forwarded message volume
Telegram	Can scrape public channels via API, or manually track private groups
🎯 KEY INDICATORS TO TRACK
Mention velocity - How fast is discussion volume growing?
Sentiment shift - Is tone flipping from negative to positive?
Cross-platform spread - Did it jump from Telegram → Reddit → Twitter?
Influencer pickup - Are big accounts starting to mention it?
Search volume spike - Google Trends confirmation
Want me to update the dashboard I built earlier to include data source configuration for these platforms, or build out a scraping/monitoring system for any specific ones?

I would like you to do both. Let's start with the. Umm. Update the dashboard to include the data source configuration for these platforms. First and we'll see how that works, and then we'll do the. Scraping monitoring system of for. You know all the things that I have like Whatsapp, Telegram and Discord after that. But do the first one first and we'll see how it goes.

Jan 30
Let me update the dashboard to include a comprehensive data source configuration panel for all these platforms.


Created a file, ran a command, read a file
Here's your updated TrendPulse v2 with a full data source configuration system. Click the ⚙️ Data Sources button in the header to access it.

Could you also upload this code to my GitHub repository? 

https://github.com/jeffharr1s/Trend-Pulse

Jan 30
I'd be happy to help upload the code to your GitHub repository, but I'm not able to authenticate with GitHub on your behalf. To push code to your repository, I would need either:

A Personal Access Token (PAT) - You can create one at GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Generate new token (with repo scope)
Or you can do it manually - which takes about 30 seconds:
Quick Manual Upload:
Go to https://github.com/jeffharr1s/Trend-Pulse
Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Drag in the trend-pulse-v2.jsx file you just downloaded
Add a commit message like "Add TrendPulse v2 with data source configuration"
Click "Commit changes"
If You Want Me to Do It:
Share a Personal Access Token with me (you can revoke it immediately after I push), and I'll:

Clone your repo
Add the files
Push with a proper commit message
Just let me know which approach you'd prefer, and if you want me to push it, paste the token and I'll handle the rest.

"Can you package all the TrendPulse Python files (backend, config, requirements.txt, etc.) for download so I can upload the complete project to GitHub?"

You are a senior full-stack dev specializing in lean trading tools. Focus ONLY on MVP for TrendPulse: Reddit/X trend monitoring → sentiment momentum → alerts/signals → quick bet APIs. NO private scrapers (Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp later), NO full backends yet—use APIs/services first (PRAW, Twitter API, Alpaca).
1. Review attached code/ZIP/repo: Identify bloat (e.g., collectors, multi-sources).
2. High-level refactor plan (3 phases max):
   - Phase 1: Core Reddit/X fetch + momentum score (0-100). Simulated data OK.
   - Phase 2: Alerts (email/Discord webhook) + signals (Buy/Sell/Watch).
   - Phase 3: Simple Alpaca/Coinbase API for $50-500 wagers.
Strict rules: KISS/YAGNI. Adhere to approved plan. Ask before additions: "Fits MVP? Y/N why." Output editable Artifact/JSX + deploy instructions (Vercel).
Confirm plan before code.

Architected lean MVP roadmap, excised bloat, prioritized core features

🔍 Bloat Analysis
File	Lines	Verdict
telegram_collector.py	500+	❌ DELETE - Private scraper, not MVP
discord_collector.py	400+	❌ DELETE - Private scraper, not MVP
whatsapp_collector.py	400+	❌ DELETE - Private scraper, not MVP
manager.py	400+	❌ DELETE - Over-abstracted
reddit_collector.py	900+	⚠️ SIMPLIFY - 90% bloat for MVP
aggregator.py	300+	⚠️ SIMPLIFY - Too complex
signal_generator.py	250+	⚠️ SIMPLIFY - Keep core logic only
alert_manager.py	350+	❌ REWRITE - Use webhooks instead
app.py	400+	❌ DELETE - No backend for MVP
trend-pulse-v2.jsx	1000+	⚠️ SIMPLIFY - Remove data source config UI
Total bloat: ~4,500 lines → Target: ~500 lines

📋 Proposed MVP Plan
Phase 1: Core Dashboard (Week 1)
Single React component (~200 lines)
Reddit fetch via PRAW → Vercel serverless function
X/Twitter: Skip for now (API costs $100/mo) OR use simulated data
Momentum score: mentions × sentiment × velocity
Display: Ticker cards with scores, basic filtering
Deploy: Vercel
Phase 2: Alerts & Signals (Week 2)
Discord webhook (POST request, free)
Email alerts via Resend (free tier: 3k/mo)
Signal logic: >70 momentum + positive sentiment = BUY
Alert triggers: Momentum spike, sentiment flip
~100 lines added
Phase 3: Quick Bets (Week 3)
Alpaca API (free, paper trading)
Coinbase API (for crypto)
Simple modal: Ticker → Amount ($50-500) → Execute
~150 lines added

Phase 1 first - Reddit + momentum + dashboard. Simulated X data. OK?
Skip Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp scrapers entirely for now. OK?
Vercel deployment - No Docker, no self-hosted backend. OK?
Twitter/X - Skip real API (costs $$$), use simulated or skip entirely? Your call.
